The data types are for mocking CKB transaction running environment. This crate is intended use as common dependency by [ckb-cli][1] and [ckb-standalone-debugger][2].

The data types are originally introduced in [ckb-cli](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-cli/blob/d6eceb3f9f108a17bcae0b1d760023e5da1e6e6a/ckb-sdk-types/src/transaction.rs), then updated in [ckb-standalone-debugger][2]. Current version modified(just fix clippy) from [ckb-standalone-debugger #5c0490cb](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-standalone-debugger/blob/5c0490cb8279f7c7860c403b9f1773b65403e57a/src/transaction.rs).
